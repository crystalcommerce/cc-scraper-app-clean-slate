CC Scraper App

    What is CC Scraper App?


        -- CC Scraper App is a web application that allows a user or developer to scrape data from any website, as long as the script needed by the application is already provided or uploaded on the application to be used for  that certain website.
        -- So this app kind of works like a gaming console... this application is the gaming console, and for anyone to be able to use the console itself, a gaming disc, or installation software has to be loaded first -- which is the script that is specifically coded to work for a website.
    
    What does it do?
        
        -- depending on how we made the scripts, ( and by scripts I mean the ones that we uploaded on to this application), this application can then scrape data, that we specified through the scripts that we uploaded. It can also download images from the website where the data will be coming from. We can then download the scraped data that are properly organized through csv files together with a subfolder for the images that it has downloaded.
        
        -- we already have samples of uploaded scripts, on to this application. We can view the details of one of the uploaded scripts, to see how it works.
        -- when we create a script, the goal is to produce, a csv file that contains the data, put that in a folder, with another subfolder, containing the images of the scraped data... the images contained in that subfolder, are also included and properly named, together with the row of data they are supposed to be aligned in.

        -- once we have scraped the data, a user may download the zipped folder of the csv and the subfolder containing the images for the data that we scraped. The user may also choose to save the data in to our database, once the scraping is done.


    How do I use it (non-developer)?

        -- most of the time, upon creating a script, we (the developers can put instructions on how to use a certain uploaded script). The user would find it just after the main header of the application, giving an example on how to use it.

    How do I create a script?

        To create a script, we have to create database schema and create eveluator functions.
            -- what is db schema and why do we need to create it... 

    How does the entire app work?

    How long will the scripts work?

    When do I have to change the scripts?

    What can we improve on the app itself?

    What are the features that other apps/websites can venefit from this application?
